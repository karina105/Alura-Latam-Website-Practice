<h1>Practice-Alura-Latam-Website</h1> 

- During the Alura Latam course, we created a fictitious webpage for a barbershop across several HTML and CSS videos. We utilized HTML semantic elements such as header, footer, and nav to structure the page's information clearly and accessibly. Additionally, we applied styles and designs using CSS to create an attractive and consistent visual appearance across all pages.
  
- We implemented links between different pages, including the main page, the page for offered products, and the contact page. Throughout the process, I learned to tackle challenges such as effective content organization and the application of consistent styles across all pages. These challenges taught me the importance of proper structure and order to avoid issues or inconsistencies in the future.
  
- This project allowed me to become familiar with the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, as well as gain practical experience in creating functional and visually appealing websites. I learned how to implement links between pages, design an intuitive user interface, and troubleshoot design and navigation issues. These skills are valuable for my professional development in the field of web development.
